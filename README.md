## Self Hosted Setup
Shello would not be Shello if we didn't allow developers to use our bot on their own systems in the easiest fashion possible. How to self host shello:

1. Edit your .env.template file and rename it to .env
2. Edit your Template.yaml file and rename it to config.yaml
3. Install ``-r requirements.txt``
4. Run the bot with python

## Acknowledgments

We'd like to thank our contributors and the staff team for making **shello** possible!
